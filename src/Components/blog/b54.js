              You must have heard the terms NYSE, BSE, NSE a thousand times,
              sometimes making the headlines of newspapers sometimes of the news
              channels, but wouldn’t have passed you like nothing unless you
              have are or have been an active trader. So, let’s try to
              understand what is a stock market. It just like any other flea
              market or what we call in Hindi <b>Bazaar</b> in the world where
              there are different products being sold. Now exchange is like a
              medium which facilitates the buying and selling of different
              financial instruments. Here the instruments are bought and sold in
              the auction format to ensure the satisfaction of buyer and the
              seller. Nowadays these auctions are done for each and every stock
              every second or you may say every millisecond using computers and
              sophisticated software programmes. But this is not what a stock
              market is, it is rather a collection of exchanges that technically
              facilitates the buying, selling, issuance of shares of
              publicly-held companies. This is done with the formal exchanges or
              Over The Counter ( OTC) market places. These shares of
              publicly-held companies, are known as stocks or equities basically
              represent the fractional ownership of the company. The stock
              market is a place where such ownership can be bought and sold. So,
              there are two types of markets, primary and secondary. Primary
              where with the help of investment banks companies offer their
              Initial Public Offering (IPO), when the company first decides to
              become a publicly traded company by offering its stock shares.
              Once, these shares are sold in the primary market, they are traded
              in what are known as <b>Secondary Markets</b> . Here the shares
              are sold by the investor who has invested in it to the another who
              wants to invest in it at the prevailing market prices. Also,
              people interchangeably use stock market and exchange, but always
              remember that the stock exchange is merely the subset of the stock
              market. Stock Markets primarily ensure that the securities are
              traded For example you can trade stocks in India using BSE, NSE,
              MCX and various other stock exchanges which are regulated by a
              local regulatory body which in India is Security and Exchange
              Board of India (SEBI). The primary function of the stock market is
              to ensure that there is complete transparency and fair dealings in
              the transactions, there is sufficient liquidity, interests of
              investors are protected, prices are discovered efficiently .i.e.
              there is a range beyond which they don’t fall or rise, supports
              all the eligible types of participants and companies listed are
              monitored. All these measures are taken in place to support and
              promote more participation and fairness for them is maintained at
              all costs and all times. To know more about trading strategies
