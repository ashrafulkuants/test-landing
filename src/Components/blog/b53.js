              . Algo trading have been here for years but the many players
              (traders/investors) still doesn’t know about the advantages of
              machine (or computer) trading over a human. In basic context, it
              is basic comparison of a human to a machine, which is often taught
              in class 3. So, let’s cover it one at a time and see how and why

              <b>1. Fatigue:</b>
              <br />
              It is one of the major reasons behind less productivity
              everywhere. Every human feels tired and fatigue and can never be
              productive to his 100% ability. Thus, it becomes a major
              superiority or advantage of a piece of program over a human. A
              computer can scan and execute multiple indicators at a speed than
              is beyond our working capabilities. More trade means more
              opportunities and which can lead to more returns, which is the
              ultimate desire of any trader or investor.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              <b>2. Emotional Bias:</b>
              <br />
              One thing that sets apart a human from a machine is his ability to
              have and show emotions. Being an advantage in many real-life
              scenarios, it can sometimes work against you, especially when you
              are trading and needs more rational thinking and less emotional
              bias.{" "}

              can be an expert in this region. Without any emotional bias,
              algo-trading follows a certain set of instructions and stick to
              it.

            <p className="mt-3">
              <b>3. Accuracy:</b>
              <br />
              Computers are way more accurate when it comes to executing a set
              of rules. Rationally, no one will move to a less accurate option,
              when a large amount of money is at stake. Making more profits is
              way easier when you can avoid a lot of pitfalls because of human
              mistakes while executing trades.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              <b>4. Reduced Transaction cost:</b>
              <br />
              Without the constant supervision of humans, computer programs can
              work for a large duration and thus reduces the cost of human
              resources. Less cost on each trade certainly improves your chances
              of making more return on your investment. This makes algo trading
              more attractive to many traders around the world.

              effectiveness (how a strategy would have performed) is measured on
              the historical data and it is assumed that if it is doing well on
              the historical or past data, it might work well on future trades
              as well. This gives the traders a huge opportunity to test and
              play around a number of strategies and remove any error from the
              trading system before it starts executing trades in real world.
