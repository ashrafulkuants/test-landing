              What are the different market instruments?
            </div>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p className="mt-3">
              Depending upon your preferences of the expectations of risk and
              return there is a huge variety of instruments which you can trade
              from. It is just similar to the flea market which have huge
              variety of products for different people having different needs.
              So, people invest in different vehicles of investments depending
              on their needs for future, their risk preferences, their own
              choices of returns, time period of return etc. It all depends on
              the individual and his choice in regard to what he invests in. We
              have 4 major asset classes:
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">1. Securities:</p>
            a) Fixed Income ( Bonds, Notes, Commercial paper)
            <br />
            b) Equity ( Common Stocks, Preferred Stocks)
            <br />
            c) Pooled Investment Vehicles ( MF, ETF, ABS)
            <br />
            <p className="mt-3"> 2. Currencies</p>
            <p className="mt-3"> 3. Contracts</p>
            <p className="mt-3"> 4. Commodities</p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Now let’s start with Fixed Income securities and try to understand
              what it is. Now, say you are a government of a nation and you want
              to raise capital for some development purpose, so you can raise
              money by borrowing it, with a promise of making fixed payments
              called “coupon” to the lender and in the end paying the face value
              of the debt. This can be done by a company/ municipality etc to
              raise money to fund for projects etc. Since, the investment in
              government bonds is considered to be the safest with lowest
              possibility of default, such bonds have lower coupon rates than
              other kind of bonds like corporate bonds. Yet they are less risky
              than equity securities with fixed monthly/ annual payments.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Investing in equity is what people consider when they hear the
              term “equity”. This is basically buying and selling stocks of
              publicly trading companies. This is an easier way of raising
              capital without the promise of regular payment, companies raise
              money by offering equity/stake in their companies. This is done by
              distribution of stocks. Here you can earn money in two ways, one
              is by dividends, which a lot of companies distribute to their
              stockholders. This can be taken as earning interest per share or a
              bonus. The other by buying and selling of the stocks.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              You must have heard about Mutual Funds, they belong to another
              category of market instruments, called the Pooled Investment
              Vehicles. The term refers to the structures where a lot of
              investors combine their investments or funds in a particular
              combination to investment in a particular set of assets. You can
              invest in mutual funds either from fund itself or in secondary
              market.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              There are other categories in Pooled Investment Vehicles as well
              it includes Exchange Traded Funds ETFs, Asset-backed Securities
              and Hedge Funds. Exchange Traded Funds trade like closed-end funds
              or say Mutual Funds but have special provisions allowing
              conversion into individual portfolio securities, or exchange of
              portfolio of shares to ETF shares. They usually track an index,
              have simple structure and low management fees as low as 0.5 to 1
              percent compared to 2 - 3 percent fees in Mutual Funds.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Asset Backed securities this is like a claim or ownership to a
              proportion of a pool or say bunch of financial assets like
              mortgages, car loans, or credit card debt. The return from these
              financial assets is passed on to the investor with different
              classes of claims depending on risk preference.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Currencies are issued by the central banks of various governments.
              The special thing about currencies is that they are traded in
              pair, USDINR, JPYINR, EURINR etc. Therefore they are priced
              relative to the base currency. The fluctuations in currencies are
              very high as they are traded by the fluctuations at the fourth
              place of the decimal.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Contract are agreements between two parties that require some
              action in the future such as exchanging an asset or cash.
              Financial contracts are often based on securities, currencies,
              commodities, or security indexes. They include futures, forwards,
              options, swaps and insurance contracts.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Commodities are trades on precious metals, agricultural products,
              industrial metals, energy products. They are traded in spot,
              futures and forward markets.

              with very high hopes of doubling quadrupling their money,this
              expectation is not wrong, it’s just the timeframe in which they
              wish to achieve such returns is wrong, such returns are possible
              given you take a time frame of 5 to 15 years. Instead if a more
              conservative approach of 15-20% return which is much higher than
              what you get in fixed deposits is more practical and feasible
              approach towards investing.

              You must have heard of the names Warren Buffet, Rakesh
              Jhunjhunwala, you must have heard different stories of their
              investment, but the most important thing that is common is the
              consistency factor, that all of them have been very consistent in
              their returns ranging around 20- 30% per year. This with the power
              of compounding is what does the true magic to their fortunes.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              So, always remember a target return of 20% is a very decent return
              one can get by investing in the stock market. As of now sensex
              trades in a range of Rs. 38,000 up from a range of Rs. 22,000 over
              a period of 5 years giving 70%. Hence, sensex itself in the long
              run has outperformed all the investment options like Fixed
              Deposits, Savings etc. One should invest in different asset
              classes like gold, fixed income securities to diversify the
              portfolio which reduces the risk.
