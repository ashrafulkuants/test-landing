              The popularity of algorithmic trading have gone off the
              roof in the last few years, majorly accounting to it’s number of
              advantages over manual trading. Algo trading have been here for
              years but the many players (traders/investors) still doesn’t know
              about the advantages of machine (or computer) trading over a
              human.

            <p className="mt-3">
              In basic context, it is basic comparison of a human to a machine,
              which is often taught in class 3. So, let’s cover it one at a time
              and see how and why algo-trading is becoming one of the greatest

              <strong>1. Fatigue:</strong>
              <br></br> It is one of the major reasons behind less productivity
              everywhere. Every human feels tired and fatigue and can never be
              productive to his 100% ability. Thus, it becomes a major
              superiority or advantage of a piece of program over a human. A
              computer can scan and execute multiple indicators at a speed than
              is beyond our working capabilities. More trade means more
              opportunities and which can lead to more returns, which is the
              ultimate desire of any trader or investor.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              <strong>2. Emotional Bias:</strong>
              <br></br> One thing that sets apart a human from a machine is his
              ability to have and show emotions. Being an advantage in many
              real-life scenarios, it can sometimes work against you, especially
              when you are trading and needs more rational thinking and less
              emotional bias. Algo trading can be an expert in this region.
              Without any emotional bias, algo-trading follows a certain set of
              instructions and stick to it.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              <strong>3. Accuracy:</strong> <br></br>Computers are way more
              accurate when it comes to executing a set of rules. Rationally, no
              one will move to a less accurate option, when a large amount of
              money is at stake. Making more profits is way easier when you can
              avoid a lot of pitfalls because of human mistakes while executing
              trades.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              <strong>4. Reduced Transaction cost:</strong>
              <br></br> Without the constant supervision of humans, computer
              programs can work for a large duration and thus reduces the cost
              of human resources. Less cost on each trade certainly improves
              your chances of making more return on your investment. This makes
              algo trading more attractive to many traders around the world.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              <strong>5. Ability to backtest:</strong> <br></br>Backtesting is a
              piece of program to help traders to measure the effectiveness of
              trading strategies. Generally, a strategy effectiveness (how a
              strategy would have performed) is measured on the historical data
              and it is assumed that if it is doing well on the historical or
              past data, it might work well on future trades as well. This gives
              the traders a huge opportunity to test and play around a number of
              strategies and remove any error from the trading system before it
              starts executing trades in real world.

              So, in brief, I would say though many risk factors are still
              associated to it (it is not 100% safe), but it is always better to
              explore more about new techniques and trends emerging in the stock
              market and especially algorithmic trading, and get a competitive
              advantage over other traders in the market.
