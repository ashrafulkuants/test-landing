              It is a computer program that emulates the behavior of the stock

              or during elections or a natural calamity and many more events
              which affect the movement of the stock market?

              It lets you know the worth of your investment strategy. It allows
              you know whether this type of approach would have worked ever in
              the historical markets or not.
              <br />
              One shouldn't live trade a strategy that has no history of giving
              good returns.
              <br />
              A question is often asked, are the results of the simulator a
              proof that the strategy will run in the future?
              <br />
              No, an excellent historical result does not guarantee similar
              profits in the future. But it does guide you to segregate good and
              bad investment ideas.
              <br />
              <br />
              Give it a thought.
              <br />
              The simulator is for strategy testing.
              <br />
              <b>Monte Carlo Simulations</b> are for checking the robustness of
