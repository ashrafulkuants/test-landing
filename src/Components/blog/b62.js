              in India one needs a PAN or an Aadhar Card for KYC procedure while
              opening an account with the market regulator, the Securities and
              Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the government has also mandated
              six-month bank statement along with a cancelled cheque, under the
              new rules to open a demat account.

            <p className="mt-3">
              Since, you cannot directly place the orders so you need to appoint
              a broker with help of whom you can place orders. There are many
              brokers available you can get in touch with. After knowing their
              terms and conditions, their fees and advisory performance and all
              you can select one according to your preference.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              After selecting a suitable broker you can open a demat account
              with them, which will hold the stocks you buy in your name. Since,
              the shares can’t be held in physical form they form the part of
              dematerialised account ( demat). To open a demat account you can
              also connect with us{" "}

              quantity, stock, price for the particular security for putting the
              order, and you need to quick and accurate as the prices change 10

              Once all this is done you are ready to enter the market. But
              before you enter the market there are few things you need to think
              about.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              From the previous videos you must have got a brief understanding
              of the markets and the different instruments present in it. You
              can get a more in depth understanding by reading various books or
              searching online through various materials available. Once, you
              get the feeling that you have the idea about how market works, how
              stock prices fluctuate, the various socioeconomic factors that
              affect the market you should start.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              To begin, you should first decide your goal depending on your
              future and current needs, funds you can invest and a broad idea
              about the time for which you want to invest. Depending on your
              goals you should begin developing your{" "}

              </a>
              . Also, when you enter the market try to understand your timing of
              entrance, if the stocks are at their all time high/low and various
              other factors and should wait for the optimum conditions for
              entering the market.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              After entering the market you should always carefully manage and
              monitor your portfolio. If a stock has fallen below a certain
              level, which you can decide, say for example 10%, you should
              immediately sell it before facing further losses. Also, don’t keep
              all the eggs in the same basket and try to diversify your
              investment to minimize the risk. Say for example if you invest
              only in auto stocks and the auto industry faces some slowdown due
              to may be say some government policy or something, your portfolio
              will be facing losses. Instead you can diversify by maybe
              investing in different sectors, which might be gaining profit at
              that time. So, this way you can reduce your losses. And this shows
              the importance of diversification.
