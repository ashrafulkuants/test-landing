              **The first requirement for algorithmic Trading is knowledge of
              computer programming languages that can allow you to create and
              run the algorithms. One alternative is to purchase software that
              has algorithms pre programmed into it.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              While buying a software system do remember to ensure that it
              fulfils both functional and non-functional requirements.
              Functional requirements specify the functions of the systems'
              components.Non functional requirements specify measures through
              which system performance is measured. A software system that
              satisfies its' functional requirements, may still not meet user
              expectations e.g. an ATs that can submit trades, but not in a
              timely manner, would cause financial losses. The software
              architecture basically provides an infrastructure which satisfies
              the non functional requirements, and within which components that
              satisfy functional requirements can be deployed, and executed.
              Algorithmic trading system requirements can therefore be broadly
              be divided into functional and non-functional requirements.
              Another is to hire programmers yourself to develop the algorithms.
              Hiring your own program developers has customisability benefits at
              the downside of additional costs

              solves this problem of yours. You neither need to hire new
              programmers nor need to know any programming language, but with
              simple mathematical or analytical logics make algorithms and apply
              them on stocks and execute trades based on them.

              ‘Making trading decision’ requires that the data is downloaded,
              filtered and both the structured and unstructured data is stored.
              Structured data includes real time market data from Reuters or
              Bloomberg transmitted using a protocol e.g. FIX. Unstructured data
              includes news and social media data.One way to gain access to the
              live data is through trading platforms in which you can execute
              the trades as well. On our platform we try to give you provide you
              a huge variety of data that could be needed at any point for
              executing your algorithm live. You don’t need to fetch it from
              anywhere. Our platform takes care of it all. Then securities are
              analysed against the trading strategy for each security. The data
              is obtained and filtered through the

              to determine which security to buy. Additionally: for each open
              position, determine which security to sell. Note: this requirement
              could vary. After trading decisions are made ’trading orders are
              created’; information for each decision like security symbol,
              price, quantity id required. For each decision, an order type is
              specified and trade information added. There are six order types:
              long, short, market, limit, stop, and conditional. Finally ‘orders
              are managed’ top level requirement there are three high level

              There are many non functional requirements which are traded off
              between each another e.g. increased performance often comes at an
              increased total cost of ownership. Non-functional algorithmic
