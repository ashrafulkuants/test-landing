              Living in this ever changing era of revolution powered by

              Now there are two things that come with automation, first and the
              foremost the accuracy at which the orders are placed, and secondly
              the number of times the orders are places. Using set of
              instruction, which is called an algorithm being given to these
              machines that execute these trades based on certain conditions set
              by the user, these machines can perform these trades 100 or 1000
              times even in a second without any error but with more accuracy
              and precision than done manually.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-3">
              This increases the entire efficiency of the trades happening
              around the globe and reduces the chance of error by human due to
              innumerable reasons. Also, since humans have a tendency to get
              attached to things, this technique reduces that scope as the
              orders here are completely taken care of by the machines. Due to
              the number of trades being executed per second it gives birth to a
              new type of trades called the High Frequency Trading. They execute
              these trades at a very high speeds in different markets keeping in
              mind the multiple decision parameters based on preprogrammed
              instructions.

              It is not just used in day trading but is also used for mid and
              long term investment by the firms which want to buy or sell large
              volume of stocks at a certain price without disturbing or
              influencing the stock prices. Firms like pension funds, mutual
              funds and insurance companies use algorithmic trading for these
              purposes.

              It is different from manual trading in the manner that trades are
              executed with the help of machines and computers instead of
              humans. Trades are executed at best possible prices, timely
              corrected and instantly to avoid significant price changes,
              reduced transaction costs, automated checks on multiple market
              conditions, can be backtested based on historical and real-time
              data to see if it is a viable trading strategy or not.
