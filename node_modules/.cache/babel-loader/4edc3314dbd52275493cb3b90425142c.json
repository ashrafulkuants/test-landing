In this way, one can better judge whether\n              the results of the backtest represent a fluke or sound trading.\n              So, always keep this in mind before choosing the start and the end\n              date\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              Above is the screenshot of the{\" \"}\n              <a\n                rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://kuants.in/blog/algolab/Setting-the-Backtesting-Environment\"\n                target=\"_blank\"\n              >\n                {\" \"}\n                backtesting\n              </a>{\" \"}\n              page of the Kuants and as you can see above are some of the\n              environmental variables that you need to set up. Don’t worry after\n              seeing such a big form, it’s not that complicated at all and you\n              can fill in depending upon your preference. Let’s begin one by\n              one, now by far testing more and more data gives you better\n              insight upon the performance of the algorithmic trading strategy.\n              The start date is the date from which date in the history you\n              decide to backtest, always remember the ideal backtest will be the\n              one that would choose sample data from a relevant time period of a\n              duration that reflects a variety of market conditions. In this\n              way, one can better judge whether the results of the backtest\n              represent a fluke or sound trading. So, always keep this in mind\n              before choosing the start and the end date\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              Unless you have reason to think that your strategy only applies to\n              recent data, I'd recommend longer backtests. If anything, it\n              should reduce the risk of over-fitting. Then comes amount of\n              initial capital you are willing to invest. I don’t think it needs\n              much explanation because you can enter the actual amount you are\n              willing to invest. So, I would advise you to enter that amount\n              itself.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              <b>Type of order:</b>\n              <br></br>\n              There are two options available for you to choose, you can either\n              choose MIS or CNC. MIS stand for Margin Intraday Orders. MIS is\n              leveraged order and can be used to leverage the available margin\n              for doing intraday square off trades. All MIS orders and positions\n              from such orders get squared off before the end of day, either by\n              the client themselves or by the trading system at pre defined\n              time, whichever is earlier.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              <b>CNC:</b>\n              <br />\n              it stands for Cash and Carry order, also known as delivery\n              trading, it will continue the order the next day as well. CNC. It\n              refers to the arrangement where the trader needs to block the\n              entire amount of required funds or shares at the time of order\n              placement. Under CNC, you can only buy stocks of amount present as\n              'Available Delivery Limits' Then come two options for maximum\n              long/short transaction or day, which means nothing but the maximum\n              time frame you want to decide or plan to long or short, if you\n              decide a timeframe and say you forget to square off your position,\n              the system would take care of that and do that. This all entirely\n              depends on you. At times it may help you save on the losses.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              <b>Dyanmic Stop loss</b>\n              <br />\n              The beauty of this is that the trade stays alive as long as it is\n              going well. When a long trade starts to break down through key\n              support levels, then this type of stop is hit and ends the trade.\n              This method is a way of letting winners run, while cutting losers\n              short.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              <b>Volume limit</b>\n              <br />\n              It is the maximum limit per transaction. It is the amount you can\n              really trade per transaction. After this come the Broker setting\n              which is basically the amount you need to pay per trade to your\n              broker, you can set this according to your broking house. Or we\n              have it set up for you. This is another very important factor that\n              you might neglect but shouldn’t as this can change the real\n              profits that you are gonna earn. So don’t miss this minute detail.\n              Some times some brokers may charge different rates depending you\n              trade in spot or futures market.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n  \n          </div></div></div></div>\n\n              )}}\n\n  export default B12;\n"],"mappings":"4cAAA,MAAOA,CAAAA,KAAP,KAAkB,OAAlB,CACA,OAAQC,MAAR,KAAqB,cAArB,C,2FAEMC,CAAAA,G,sGACF,aAAYC,KAAZ,CAAmB,qCACf,uBAAMA,KAAN,EAGA,MAAKC,KAAL,CAAa,CACXC,IAAI,CAAE,EADK,CAEXC,KAAK,CAAE,EAFI,CAAb,CAJe,aAQhB,C,kDAED,6BAAqB,CAEpB,C,sBAED,iBAAS,CACP,mBACE,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,sBAAf,uBACE,kCAEJ,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,eAAf,wBACE,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,+BAAf,wBACV,YAAK,GAAG,CAAC,mBAAT,CAA6B,KAAK,CAAC,KAAnC,EADU,cAEV,mCACA,WAAI,SAAS,CAAC,4BAAd,uBAA2C,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,OAAR,CAAgB,MAAM,CAAC,OAAvB,2BAA3C,EADA,cAGE,WAAI,SAAS,CAAC,2BAAd,uBAA0C,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,2BAAR,CAAoC,MAAM,CAAC,OAA3C,iCAA1C,EAHF,cAIE,WAAI,SAAS,CAAC,2BAAd,uBAA0C,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,0BAAR,CAAmC,MAAM,CAAC,OAA1C,iCAA1C,EAJF,cAKE,WAAI,SAAS,CAAC,2BAAd,uBAA0C,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,qBAAR,CAA8B,MAAM,CAAC,OAArC,4BAA1C,EALF,cAME,WAAI,SAAS,CAAC,2BAAd,uBAA0C,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,eAAR,CAAwB,MAAM,CAAC,OAA/B,qBAA1C,EANF,cAOE,WAAI,SAAS,CAAC,2BAAd,uBAA0C,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,yBAAR,CAAkC,MAAM,CAAC,OAAzC,+BAA1C,EAPF,GAFU,GADF,cAcR,aAAK,SAAS,CAAC,oBAAf,wBACA,YAAI,KAAK,CAAC,YAAV,wBACE,iCAAI,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,GAAR,kBAAJ,EADF,cAEE,iCAAI,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,OAAR,kBAAJ,EAFF,cAGE,iCAAI,UAAG,IAAI,CAAC,2BAAR,iCAAJ,EAHF,cAIE,iDAJF,GADA,cAQM,YAAK,SAAS,CAAC,WAAf,uCARN,kCAUmC,aACvB,SAAS,CAAC,iBADa,CAEvB,EAAE,CAAC,MAFoB,wBAIvB,MAAC,MAAD,yBACF,iEADE,cAEF,aAAM,IAAI,CAAE,cAAZ,CAA2B,OAAO,CAAC,gJAAnC,EAFE,cAIF,aAAM,GAAG,CAAC,WAAV,CAAsB,IAAI,CAAC,mDAA3B,EAJE,GAJuB,cAWvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,mGAEqB,GAFrB,cAGE,UACE,GAAG,CAAC,qBADN,CAC4B,IAAI,CAAC,uEADjC,CAEE,MAAM,CAAC,QAFT,iCAHF,eASc,GATd,cAUE,UACE,GAAG,CAAC,qBADN,CAC4B,IAAI,CAAC,wEADjC,CAEE,MAAM,CAAC,QAFT,yBAVF,CAeO,GAfP,6KAkBuC,GAlBvC,cAmBE,WAAG,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAP,CAA6B,IAAI,CAAC,sDAAlC,CAAyF,MAAM,CAAC,QAAhG,WACG,GADH,iBAnBF,CAsBO,GAtBP,6BAuB4B,GAvB5B,cAwBE,qBAIG,GAJH,sBAxBF,CA+BG,GA/BH,8TAXuB,cAiDvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,mDAEE,gEAFF,sFAjDuB,cAsDvB,UAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,uXAtDuB,cA8DvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,qMAIE,UAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,+XAJF,GA9DuB,cA2EvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,2JAGE,UAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,+dAHF,GA3EuB,cAyFvB,UAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,8HAzFuB,cA6FvB,UAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,wQA7FuB,cAmGvB,uEACkD,GADlD,cAEE,WAAG,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAP,CAA6B,IAAI,CAAC,yBAAlC,CAA4D,MAAM,CAAC,QAAnE,oBACS,GADT,GAFF,CAIO,GAJP,GAnGuB,cAyGvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,wBACE,+BADF,oNAIgC,GAJhC,cAKE,WAAG,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAP,CAA6B,IAAI,CAAC,yBAAlC,CAA4D,MAAM,CAAC,QAAnE,qCAC0B,GAD1B,GALF,qEAQoE,GARpE,cASE,WAAG,GAAG,CAAC,qBAAP,CAA6B,IAAI,CAAC,qCAAlC,CAAwE,MAAM,CAAC,QAA/E,iDACsC,GADtC,GATF,CAWO,GAXP,GAzGuB,cAsHvB,UAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,i3BAtHuB,cAsIvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,4CACiC,GADjC,cAEE,WACE,GAAG,CAAC,qBADN,CAC4B,IAAI,CAAC,oEADjC,CAEE,MAAM,CAAC,QAFT,WAIG,GAJH,iBAFF,CAQO,GARP,8zBAtIuB,cA6JvB,UAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,yZA7JuB,cAsKvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,wBACE,qCADF,cAEE,aAFF,uaAtKuB,cAiLvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,wBACE,2BADF,cAEE,aAFF,osBAjLuB,cAgMvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,wBACE,wCADF,cAEE,aAFF,iRAhMuB,cAyMvB,WAAG,SAAS,CAAC,MAAb,wBACE,mCADF,cAEE,aAFF,sjBAzMuB,GAVnC,GAdQ,GAFI,EADF,EADF,CAsPQ,C,iBAtQEN,KAAK,CAACO,S,EAwQtB,cAAeL,CAAAA,GAAf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
