It is just similar to the flea market which have huge\n              variety of products for different people having different needs.\n              So, people invest in different vehicles of investments depending\n              on their needs for future, their risk preferences, their own\n              choices of returns, time period of return etc. It all depends on\n              the individual and his choice in regard to what he invests in. We\n              have 4 major asset classes:\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">1. Securities:</p>\n            a) Fixed Income ( Bonds, Notes, Commercial paper)\n            <br />\n            b) Equity ( Common Stocks, Preferred Stocks)\n            <br />\n            c) Pooled Investment Vehicles ( MF, ETF, ABS)\n            <br />\n            <p className=\"mt-3\"> 2. Currencies</p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\"> 3. Contracts</p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\"> 4. Commodities</p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              Now let’s start with Fixed Income securities and try to understand\n              what it is. Now, say you are a government of a nation and you want\n              to raise capital for some development purpose, so you can raise\n              money by borrowing it, with a promise of making fixed payments\n              called “coupon” to the lender and in the end paying the face value\n              of the debt. This can be done by a company/ municipality etc to\n              raise money to fund for projects etc. Since, the investment in\n              government bonds is considered to be the safest with lowest\n              possibility of default, such bonds have lower coupon rates than\n              other kind of bonds like corporate bonds. Yet they are less risky\n              than equity securities with fixed monthly/ annual payments.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              Investing in equity is what people consider when they hear the\n              term “equity”. This is basically buying and selling stocks of\n              publicly trading companies. This is an easier way of raising\n              capital without the promise of regular payment, companies raise\n              money by offering equity/stake in their companies. This is done by\n              distribution of stocks. Here you can earn money in two ways, one\n              is by dividends, which a lot of companies distribute to their\n              stockholders. This can be taken as earning interest per share or a\n              bonus. The other by buying and selling of the stocks.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              You must have heard about Mutual Funds, they belong to another\n              category of market instruments, called the Pooled Investment\n              Vehicles. The term refers to the structures where a lot of\n              investors combine their investments or funds in a particular\n              combination to investment in a particular set of assets. You can\n              invest in mutual funds either from fund itself or in secondary\n              market.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              There are other categories in Pooled Investment Vehicles as well\n              it includes Exchange Traded Funds ETFs, Asset-backed Securities\n              and Hedge Funds. Exchange Traded Funds trade like closed-end funds\n              or say Mutual Funds but have special provisions allowing\n              conversion into individual portfolio securities, or exchange of\n              portfolio of shares to ETF shares. They usually track an index,\n              have simple structure and low management fees as low as 0.5 to 1\n              percent compared to 2 - 3 percent fees in Mutual Funds.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              Asset Backed securities this is like a claim or ownership to a\n              proportion of a pool or say bunch of financial assets like\n              mortgages, car loans, or credit card debt. The return from these\n              financial assets is passed on to the investor with different\n              classes of claims depending on risk preference.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              Currencies are issued by the central banks of various governments.\n              The special thing about currencies is that they are traded in\n              pair, USDINR, JPYINR, EURINR etc. Therefore they are priced\n              relative to the base currency. The fluctuations in currencies are\n              very high as they are traded by the fluctuations at the fourth\n              place of the decimal.\n            </p>\n            <p className=\"mt-3\">\n              Contract are agreements between two parties that require some\n              action in the future such as exchanging an asset or cash.\n              Financial contracts are often based on securities, currencies,\n              commodities, or security indexes.
