AlgoTrading involves building and\n//               implementing trading strategies using computer codes and\n//               programming. A trading strategy is basically a plan or a set of\n//               rules which are defined to conduct the process of buying and\n//               selling while trading in order to achieve a particular outcome\n//               like increasing profitability, better execution, etc. These\n//               trading strategies can be tested on historical data to evaluate\n//               how they’d have performed if they were traded as per the\n//               parameters during the given time period. This process is called as\n//               Backtesting, which helps one minimise losses and maximise profits\n//               as per analysis of their performance on the historical data. How\n//               is AlgoTrading different from manual trading?

Second, trading skills to incorporate\n//             the basic knowledge of the working of financial markets and what\n//             affects them.

In\n//             developed markets where Algotrading has been there for decades,\n//             Algotrading already accounts for more than 80% of the trading\n//             volumes in leading exchanges. Indian markets, which witnessed\n//             Algotrading that was allowed by SEBI in 2008, today are also seeing\n//             rapid growth in the share of Algotrading with more than 40% of\n//             exchange volumes already being driven by algorithms.
