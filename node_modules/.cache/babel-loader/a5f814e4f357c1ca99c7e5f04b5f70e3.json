Second, trading skills to incorporate\n//             the basic knowledge of the working of financial markets and what\n//             affects them.

In\n//             developed markets where Algotrading has been there for decades,\n//             Algotrading already accounts for more than 80% of the trading\n//             volumes in leading exchanges. Indian markets, which witnessed\n//             Algotrading that was allowed by SEBI in 2008, today are also seeing\n//             rapid growth in the share of Algotrading with more than 40% of\n//             exchange volumes already being driven by algorithms.
