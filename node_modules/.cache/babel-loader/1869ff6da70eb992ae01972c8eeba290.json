Any or all of the systems comprising our infrastructure could entirely or partially fail, function erratically, or function very slowly (thereby leading to latency, i.e., delays in receipt of and response to user requests).</p>\n                <p>ii. We may inadvertently cause a systems failure during planned or unplanned system maintenance.</p>\n                <p>iii. We may undertake software upgrades, either planned or unplanned, that take longer to implement or that causes your computer system or Internet connectivity to fail.</p>\n                <p>iv. We may change or remove functions and features whose change or removal causes your system to fail, function erratically, or function very slowly.</p>\n                <p>c. Your computer system and your Internet connectivity may fail.</p>\n                <p>Any of the components of your computer system and/or your Internet connectivity could fail entirely, function erratically, or function very slowly.

(Kuants Wealth Private Limited) provides you only with trading technology and can provide no investment, financial, regulatory, tax or legal advice.</p>\n                <p>2. Risks in Create, and Backtest Algos (Algorithms)</p>\n                <p>Creating and backtesting trading algorithms is subject to several risks, any of which can cause your algorithms to not function as you had intended or fail to achieve one or more of the objectives of your algorithms. Algorithmic trading is rapidly changing as a practice and as an industry. Models of markets used to write and test trading algorithms are inherently limited and often fail to perform as expected. In addition, trading algorithms are implemented in software programming code, and no matter how well designed and thoroughly tested, any such code can have logical errors and bugs that cause the algorithms to malfunction or suggest trades that, if executed, would result in losses. It is your obligation to thoroughly and appropriately test any trading algorithm before you deploy it and to continually monitor the operation of any deployed trading algorithm to ensure it is running properly and in compliance with any applicable rules</p>\n                <p>a. Your algorithm may be designed on the basis of an incorrect understanding of technical indicators which may not work as expected.</p>\n                <p>b. Your algorithm may contain logical errors in the way you understand the indicators and comparators.</p>\n                <p>c. Errors may exist in the data used for testing your algorithm or the applicable model of the market.</p>\n                <p>d. Your algorithm might appear to succeed in a backtesting environment using historical data,</p>\n                <p>e. Your algorithm might appear to succeed with some data sources, but fail when using other data sources in our system.</p>\n                <p>f. Your algorithm may not achieve the returns you anticipate. There are no guarantees, or even expectations, that can be made about the future behavior of an algorithm.</p>\n                <p>g. Backtesting Cannot Assure Actual Results.</p>\n                <p>It is not possible for a computer model to truly predict what might have happened if an algorithm-based trading strategy was in play in a live trading environment. For example, the implementation of such a strategy can itself have an impact on the market, and the model may fail to account for real-life factors that impact the model. Moreover, the model may fail to account for execution costs including broker commissions, fees, and trading slippage.</p>\n                <p>A promising model result does not necessarily predict a successful strategy. A backtest might be over-fitted to past data, and fail when the strategy is applied to new, live data. Your algorithm might not handle market conditions that cannot be reasonably anticipated, i.e., a &ldquo;flash crash&rdquo; or an exchange outage. These market conditions, by definition, will not have been tested.</p>\n                <p>h.The relevant market might fail or behave unexpectedly. Market centers in which you seeking to implement your trading strategy may fail or behave incorrectly because of technical reasons relating to infrastructure, connectivity, and similar factors.</p>\n                <p>Your algorithm might suffer from adverse market conditions. Those conditions can include a lack of liquidity and abrupt and unwarranted price swings. Also possible are late market openings, early market closings, market chaos, and mid-day trading pauses, and other such disruptive events.</p>\n                <p>i. You may receive incorrect information, or be unable to get information, about your orders, your positions, or market conditions. Incorrect actions may be taken, or corrective actions may not be taken, because of inaccurate or missing information. In addition, you may be unable to terminate or edit your algorithm.</p>\n                <p>k. Malicious and criminal activities might cause your algorithms and strategy to fail.</p>\n                <p>All computers and networks are subject to malicious &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; attacks and criminal activities designed to misappropriate the intellectual property, compromise personally identifiable information, steal funds, or any combination of such purposes. These attacks might be attacks on a target of opportunity or specifically targeted. Any such attack could cause the system so attacked to function improperly or not at all and could result in the misappropriation of your intellectual property, the compromise of your personally identifiable information and personal financial information, the theft of your funds and can cause your algo to be misbehave, malfunction or behave erratically. Kuants Wealth Private Limited cannot be held liable and no legal action can be initiated against Kuants Wealth Private Limited, in any case of an external attack by a malicious entity that leads to disclosure of personal data, algorithms or any other data a user has created, submitted or stored with Kuants Wealth Private Limited Kuants Wealth Private Limited, in any case, be held liable to any loss of intellectual property, content, harm to reputation, damage, etc.</p>\n               </div>\n               <div id=\"Refund-Policy\">\n                <h1 >Refund Policy</h1>\n                <p>We do not offer any refund on any subscription, live trading, or in any other condition.
